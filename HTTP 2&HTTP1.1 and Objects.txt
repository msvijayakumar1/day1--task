Objects and it's internal representation in JavaScript:-

           Objects, in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building
blocks for modern JavaScript. These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s
primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the 
sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each (depending 
on their types).

           Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, 
of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. These keys can be 
variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context 
of an object .

Difference between HTTP1.1& HTTP2:-

            HTTP2 is much faster and more reliable than HTTP1.1. HTTP1.1 loads a single request
 for every TCP connection, while HTTP2 avoids network delay by using multiplexing. HTTP is 
a network delay sensitive protocol in the sense that if there is less network delay, then 
the page loads faster .
